        <p>
          In recent years, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology has been applied throughout 
          the entire spectrum of industries, revolutionizing the document management process. 
          OCR has enabled scanned documents to become more than just image files, turning into fully 
          searchable documents with text content that is recognized by computers. With the help of OCR, 
          people no longer need to manually retype important documents when entering them into electronic 
          databases. Instead, OCR extracts relevant information and enters it automatically. 
          The result is accurate, efficient information processing in less time.

          By integrating AI and Machine Learning based technologies, a number of important business 
          problems can be solved very effectively without human intervention.  They include scanning of 
          boxes of documents and storing retrieved textual and numeric data them in database. 
          It allows to effectively keep track of records, simplifies data collection and following analyses.

        Goals of Document solution:
        <ol>
        <li>AI based integrated solution to extract textual and numeric information from PDF and image 
          files in the form of text and present this information in a convenient (e.g. tabular) format.</li>
        <li>Organize storage of this information in database for following  quick search and extraction.</li>
        <li>Textual analytics: document summarization, classification, finding similar documents, 
            named entity recognition, etc., using Natural Language Processing.</li>
        </ol>
